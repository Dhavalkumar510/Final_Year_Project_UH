# Predicting Future Stock Trends: An Analytical Approach Using Lloyds Banking Group Data 

Stock market forecasting supports informed decision-making by predicting price movements influenced by macroeconomic trends, investor sentiment, and geopolitical events. This project analyzes Lloyds Banking Group PLC's stock prices using LSTM and ARIMA models with historical data from 2010 to present. The goal is to assess their effectiveness in real-world financial forecasting.

## Models 
LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory

SARIMA: Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average

Prophet: Additive Model for Forecasting Time Series (developed by Facebook)

Holt-Winters: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing
## Optimizations

This project optimized forecasting accuracy through hyperparameter tuning (LSTM units, dropout rates, activation functions), advanced preprocessing (data cleaning, scaling), and incorporating domain-specific insights like seasonality and holiday effects. Models were evaluated using metrics (R², MSE, RMSE), and a comparative analysis identified the best-performing approach for stock price prediction.
